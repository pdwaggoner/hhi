#' Calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
#'
#' Computes the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of a market/space, which is a measure of concentration, based on the share size of all individual firms/actors
#'@usage hhi(x, "s")
#'@param x Name of the data frame
#'@param s Name of the vector (variable) from the data frame, x, corresponding with stored market share values
#'@details Allows for placing the objects directly from working datasets (including, data frame and the market share variable name in quotes) into the function for intuitive usage.
#'@return hhi A measure of market concentration
#'@note The vector of "share" values should be comprised of integers corresponding to total share of individual firms/actors (e.g., df$s <- c(35, 40, 5, 10, 6, 4) # 6 firms totaling 100 percent of the market). The measure is often used as a measure of competition, where 0 is perfect competitiveness and 10,000 is a perfect monopoly.
